It's fast, lightweight, and simple. Hive is a PHP framework based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, designed to provide you with a clear, basic structure for your projects.

- An agile and dynamic route management system, ready for multi-language projects.
- Working with views or the database is incredibly convenient, flexible, and secure.
- A CSS class and component architecture designed for fast, organized, and responsive design.
